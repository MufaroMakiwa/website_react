          <p>
            We are the African Studentsâ€™ Associations of the Massachusetts Institute
            of Technology, otherwise known as MIT Africans or ASA. We bring African
            culture to the MIT community, and we foster a community of diverse
            students with an interest in African culture and ongoing activities.
          </p>
          <h1>Our Goal</h1>
          <p>
            We aim to provide a learning environment for anything African related; to
            increase awareness about Africa and Africans among MIT students; showcase
            the various aspect of the African culture such as ways of life, food,
            music, and clothing; to assist new MIT members in adjusting to the MIT
            lifestyle, and to present Africa from the African perspective.
